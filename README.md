## Portfolio
>Immersed in the world of quantitative finance, I have a profound interest in applying statistical and mathematical techniques to analyse investment opportunities. Over the past two years of pursuing my master’s degree, I've explored intriguing subjects such as Monte Carlo Simulations, Copula’s, Lévy model, PCA, among others. This has ignited a keen desire to further develop my knowledge and pursue a professional journey in quantitative finance. Hence, I've established this portfolio to showcase the various topics I've delved into during my master’s degree.
